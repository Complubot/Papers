\section{Introduction}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Achievements
%
% One paragraph to summarize the experience and achievements of your team.
% The main focus should be on describing the solution and not the team.

\subsection{Team achievements}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Robot description
%
% Unless your research revolves around hardware design and implementation, it is better to omit this section
% Avoid explaining ROS
% Keep it simple, more descriptive and less analytic.
% The main goal of a TDP is tell others about your latest practical achievement, what strategy was chosen and why, while at the same time trying to convince your reader that what you are doing is useful or applicable in a daily life scenario

% Content
%
% Innovative technology and scientific contribution
% Focus of research/research interests
% Re-usability of the system for other research groups
% Applicability of the robot in the real world
% When the robot depicted in the TDP or Team Video is different from the league's standard one, the TDP must clearly state how the addressed approach and described software will be adapted to the standard platform robot.
% Everything must be in perfect standard scientific English
