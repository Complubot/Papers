% OPL Annex
%
% Recommended 1 page
% The TDP's Robot Description Annex is an appendix of arbitrary length that must be attached at the end of the TDP and summarize the robot's software and hardware technical specifications.
% In this section briefly describe the software and hardware of the robot
%
% Purpose
% It allows the league to track changes in hardware and software trends over time.
% It helps experienced teams to find alternatives to their solutions when looking to improve or conducting benchmarking.
% It serves as a quick reference guide for new teams while preparing their robots.
